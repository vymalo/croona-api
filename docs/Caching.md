# Caching in the Application

## Overview

Caching is a crucial technique for optimizing the speed and performance of your application by storing frequently
accessed data or computations. In the context of our application, we will use caching to store and retrieve our
permissions data.

By caching the permissions data, we can significantly reduce the number of file I/O operations, which are generally
slower than accessing data from memory (where the cache resides). This means a faster, more responsive application,
especially when dealing with a large number of requests or complex permissions configurations.

## Benefits

Using caching in our application brings several benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**: Caching frequently accessed data in memory reduces the time needed to fetch this data, thus
   improving the overall speed and responsiveness of the application.
2. **Reduced Load on File System**: By reducing the need to frequently read from the file system, we can lessen the
   overall load on the file system and improve the performance of other operations that need to access the file system.
3. **Scalability**: As our application grows and serves more users, caching can help ensure that our application
   continues to perform well under larger loads. Additionally, if we choose to use a distributed cache like Redis in the
   future, this can also help improve the scalability of our application by sharing the cache across multiple instances
   of our application.

## How It Works

The built-in caching in NestJS will serve our needs well initially. We start with in-memory caching for simplicity. As
the application grows and our needs change, we can switch to a more scalable and distributed cache storage like Redis.

We abstract our cache access behind a service. This service handles getting permissions from the cache, as well as
loading them into the cache from your YAML file when necessary.

Here's an example of what such a service might look like:

```typescript
import { Injectable, CacheStore, CACHE_MANAGER, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';

@Injectable()
export class PermissionsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(CACHE_MANAGER) private cacheManager: CacheStore,
    private configService: ConfigService,
  ) {
    this.loadPermissionsIntoCache();
  }

  async loadPermissionsIntoCache() {
    const permissions = loadPermissionsFromYaml(this.configService.get('PERMISSIONS_FILE_PATH'));
    await this.cacheManager.set('permissions', permissions);
  }

  async getPermissions() {
    let permissions = await this.cacheManager.get('permissions');
    if (!permissions) {
      this.loadPermissionsIntoCache();
      permissions = await this.cacheManager.get('permissions');
    }
    return permissions;
  }
}
```

In this example, `loadPermissionsFromYaml` is a function that reads the permissions from your YAML file and transforms
them into the format needed by your application. The `loadPermissionsIntoCache` method is called in the constructor to
ensure that the permissions are loaded into the cache when the service is instantiated.

## Considerations for Production Deployments

When deploying the application in a production environment, there are a few things to consider:

- **Cache Invalidation**: It's crucial to handle cache expiration and invalidation correctly. When the permissions data
  changes, the cache should be updated as soon as possible. This can be achieved by setting an appropriate TTL (Time to
  Live) value when putting data into the cache. The data will be automatically removed from the cache after this period.

- **Distributed Caching**: As your application scales and you start running multiple instances of it, you'll need a
  distributed caching solution. This allows all instances to share the same cache, ensuring that they all have access to
  the most up-to-date data. Redis is a popular choice for this use case.

- **Memory Usage**: While caching can significantly improve performance, it's important to monitor the memory usage of
  your application. Caching too much data can lead to high memory usage, which could impact the performance of your
  application or even cause it to crash if the memory limit is exceeded. It's essential to strike a balance between
  caching for performance and managing memory usage.

By keeping these considerations in mind, you can effectively use caching to improve the performance and scalability of
your application.
